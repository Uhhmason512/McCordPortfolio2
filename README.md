Developed a very basic model of a social media app in highscool with my friend Alan Dang. Got my class to log in and talk to each other. We used free firebase servers for initial testing (Thanks Amazon!)

If I were to create a social networking app now (which I am thinking of doing) I would work smarter not harder. I've done a little research and Apache tools can help me create the UI without having to start from scratch. Also if I did need to use swift, I would use a virtual environment to circumvent using my underpowered, outdated macbook air and to stay on windows products.

Very cool experience in highschool which helped me get more interested in coding/engineering.
