My name is Mason McCord, I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering student graduating Dec. 2024 and looking for employment. I'm a life-long hobbyist and tinkerer. The following repository is to show the different small coding projects that I worked on during my time at school and interning with the Boeing company.

Despite being early into my professional career I have experience doing structures work for the defense side of GE Aerospace. I performed full-scale product development, GD&T, test plans, and requirements reconciliation for Unison Industries. CAD mapping and Excel Cost Projection tools at Duke Energy.
